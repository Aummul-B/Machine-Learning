   1. Boston Housing Prices:  
   *  The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a               modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
      
      
   2.  Training a smart Cab:
      * Reinforcement Learning
         In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through          its environment towards a goal. Since the Smartcab is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving            agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its            destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that          frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered unreliable. Maximizing the driving agent's safety and              reliability would ensure to Smartcabs have a permanent place in the transportation industry.
   
    3. Titanic Survival Exploration:
      * 10 feautures used to predict whether the passenger might have survived or not. [Kaggle Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

      * Goal is to identify students who might need early intervention. Classification is done to classify students in either of the two           categories based on 30 features. Target value is either the student passed (passed='yes') or not (passed='no'). 

    5. Others: 
      * Gradient Descent implementation (Python)
      * Spam classification
