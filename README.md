   3. ### [Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sprataps/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Boston_Housing):  
   *  The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a               modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
      
      
   4. ### [Training a smart Cab](https://github.com/sprataps/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Smart%20Cab):
      * Reinforcement Learning
         In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through          its environment towards a goal. Since the Smartcab is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving            agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its            destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that          frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered unreliable. Maximizing the driving agent's safety and              reliability would ensure to Smartcabs have a permanent place in the transportation industry.

    5. ### [Titanic Survival Exploration](https://github.com/sprataps/Machine-Learning/tree/master/titanic_survivor_exploration):
      * 10 feautures used to predict whether the passenger might have survived or not. [Kaggle Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) 

    6.  ### [Student Intervention](https://github.com/sprataps/Machine-Learning/tree/master/Student%20Intervention):
      * Dive in to understand the various factors behind students who pass and who don't. Understand various factors that may indicate whether a student(probable to fail)  needs an intervention or not. Example:
