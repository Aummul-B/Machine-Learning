   ..1. Boston Housing Prices: 
     * Data </br>
      The modified Boston housing dataset consists of 489 data points, with each datapoint having 3 features. This dataset is a </br>           modified version of the Boston Housing dataset found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. </br>

     * Features

      - RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
      - LSTAT: percentage of population considered lower status
      - PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
      - Target Variable 4. MEDV: median value of owner-occupied homes
      
    ..2.  Training a smart Cab:
      * Reinforcement Learning
         In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through            its environment towards a goal. Since the Smartcab is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving              agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: Safety and Reliability. A driving agent that gets the Smartcab to its              destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered unsafe. Similarly, a driving agent that            frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered unreliable. Maximizing the driving agent's safety and                reliability would ensure to Smartcabs have a permanent place in the transportation industry.
